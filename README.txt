Thank you for downloading!

This mod changes the color of the Polish tanks from their default brown to a semi-historical gray-green color.
Included are skins for all Polish vehicles and matching icons for the garage and tech tree.

To install:
- Drop the "CWW-RecolorPack-Polish-Szarozielony-Gray-Green" folder from inside the "MAIN MOD - COLOR CHANGE" folder into <Your WoT Directory>\mods\<game version number>. Example: C:\Games\World_Of_Tanks\mods\1.0.2.4.

Optional:
- If you want to also change the default Polish emblem, drop the "CWW-PolishEmblemReplacement.wotmod" file from inside the "ADDON - POLISH EMBLEM SWAP" folder to <Your WoT Directory>\mods\<Game Version>. (Example: C:\Games\World_Of_Tanks\mods\1.0.2.4). I have included a preview image in the same folder as well, so you know what to expect.

- Additionally, if you want mod support for the Dakka Improvement Project, drag the "vehicles" folder from "ADDON - MOD SUPPORT, goes in res_mods version folder (Dakka Improvement Project)" into 
<Your WoT Directory>\res_mods\<game version number>. Example: C:\Games\World_Of_Tanks\res_mods\1.0.2.4.

Enjoy!
